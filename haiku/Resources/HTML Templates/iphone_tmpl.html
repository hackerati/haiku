    A Tree in the Marsh
  </div>
	<div class="poem-text">
		Born in the lowland<br/>
    protected from the wind<br/>
    this tree was living<br/>
    a good life always...<br/>
    <br/>
    blossoming out in the spring breeze,<br/>
    giving shades to summer birds,<br/>
    dressing up in gold in autumn,<br/>
    sleeping in peace through wnter;<br/>
    <br/>
    and now...<br/>
    he is awake and content.<br/>
    <br/>
    Many years have passed.<br/>
    It has been an ordinary life<br/>
    with happiness and sadness;<br/>
    <br/>
    and now...<br/>
    the lowland is sunk in water.<br/>
    <br/>
    Standing there valiantly<br/>
    is this old tree,<br/>
    no more flowers and golden leaves;<br/>
    <br/>
    and now...<br/>
    only offering<br/>
    proud silence<br/>
    in the marsh.<br/>
    <br/>
    t.m.s.
