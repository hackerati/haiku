# haiku
A memorial app for Geoff

## Requirements
* Mac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8)
* XCode 5 and iOS 7 SDK
* iOS device runnning iOS 7 (optional)

## Installation
* Clone the repository
* Initialize submodules:

		git submodule init
		git submodule update

* That's it!

## Updating the DB
The PoemData.sqlite static file is generated by the included project PoemData (in Third-Party Resources). To update the database (ie: add a new field to entities):
* Make your changes in the PoemData project
* Run the PoemData project. Upon success, the console will indicate that path where the sqlite database was saved:

		PoemData[44497:303] Saving generated db to /Users/kevin.tulod/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/PoemData-gkddjtixxxebpkedjbfibihnthpa/Build/Products/Debug/PoemData.sqlite
		Program ended with exit code: 0

* Overwrite haiku/PoemData.sqlite with that generated file.
* If you made any changes to HKPoem, HKCategory, or HKPoemDataModel.xcdatamodeld, you may have to restart the haiku Xcode.
* If you added any new entities to the database, add the reference to the .h and .m files in the Haiku project.
